# Safe Key Sheet

Key vaults can protect many accounts and passwords.
However, in the case of a disaster or death, it is important to be able to recover the vault itself.
This is a tool to generate a print of key entries, along with the password for the vault itself.

Tag any entry with "safe-print" to add to print.
Optionally create a new entry called "safe-print". The Notes section will be used for general instructions.

Invoke with:
```
safekeysheet gen -kdbx passbox.kdbx
```
